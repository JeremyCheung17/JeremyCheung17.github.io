Hi! I'm an aspiring Software Engineer who enjoys learning and problem-solving. I like to work with people and am always open to feedback and new perspectives.

Right now, I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Stony Brook University, where I am enrolled in its Honors Program. 

In my free time, I like to keep up with current events, cook, and play video games.

I am currently looking for a Summer 2024 Internship in Software Engineering.
